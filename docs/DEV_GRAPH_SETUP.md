# Dev-Graph Setup Summary

## âœ… Updates Completed

### 1. FastAPI Port Configuration
- **Status**: âœ… Already configured correctly
- **Port**: 8000 (configured in both `.env` and `main.py`)
- **Configuration files**:
  - `mock-backend/.env`: `PORT=8000`
  - `mock-backend/main.py`: `port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000))`

### 2. Makefile Updates
- **New command**: `make dev-graph`
- **Functionality**: Runs both Next.js frontend and LangGraph FastAPI server simultaneously
- **Ports**:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - LangGraph API: http://localhost:8000

## ðŸš€ Available Commands

### Main Development Commands
```bash
# Run Next.js + LangGraph FastAPI together
make dev-graph

# Run individual services
make dev-graph-backend    # LangGraph FastAPI only
make dev-frontend         # Next.js only

# Original mock server setup
make dev                  # Next.js + Mock backend
```

### LangGraph Management
```bash
make langgraph-setup      # Setup environment files
make langgraph-install    # Install Python dependencies
make langgraph-test       # Test server configuration
```

### Utility Commands
```bash
make status               # Check running services
make stop                 # Stop all services
make help                 # Show all available commands
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Command Implementation
The `dev-graph` command uses Make's parallel execution (`-j2`) to run:
1. **Frontend**: `bun run dev` (Next.js on port 3000)
2. **Backend**: `uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

### Virtual Environment Handling
- The LangGraph server runs in its own `.venv` managed by UV
- No conflicts with the main project dependencies
- Isolated Python environment in `mock-backend/`

### Process Management
- Both services run as background processes
- Can be stopped together with `make stop`
- Status monitoring with `make status`

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Instructions

1. **Setup LangGraph environment** (one-time):
   ```bash
   make langgraph-setup
   # Edit mock-backend/.env with your Azure OpenAI credentials
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (one-time):
   ```bash
   make langgraph-install
   ```

3. **Test the setup**:
   ```bash
   make langgraph-test
   ```

4. **Start development**:
   ```bash
   make dev-graph
   ```

5. **Access the applications**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - LangGraph API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## âœ¨ Benefits

- **Parallel Development**: Work on frontend and backend simultaneously
- **Isolated Environments**: No dependency conflicts between Node.js and Python
- **Hot Reloading**: Both services support automatic reloading on changes
- **Easy Management**: Simple commands to start, stop, and monitor services
- **Production Ready**: FastAPI server configured for optimal performance
